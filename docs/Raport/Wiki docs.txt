Social Recommender is an application that has been set to recommend certain people, events, books, music, institutes based on a social network that the user has to connect to. The social network used is Facebook.
What is great in this app is that the user can receive random recommendations even thought he registered for the first time. 
The recommendations are based on information acquired from Facebook profile, and includes the information from user's friends, and friends of friends. 
The results will be displayed as a list of potential interests. 
Users have the possibility to create his own favourite list of results,list that will be saved in user's profile. Apart from this applicability, as an improvement of the random and on request recommendations, the user can also select the most unliked results. In this way, the results are based on more search criterias that lead to a more acurate understanding of users interests.

Results are displayed in Homepage, containing:
name of the results
description
others, according to the selected criteria or according to the recommendations(random or requested).

The constraints of the number of items displayed are:
minimum number of results: 5
maximum number of results: 50
default: 10

Resources that will be used to get better results are:
